# Regional-Residual Separation using Polynomial Fitting

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates regional-residual separation using polynomial fitting. The approach leverages the [Verde](https://github.com/fatiando/verde) Python library, part of the **Fatiando a Terra** suite, to efficiently perform the separation of regional and residual components in geophysical data.

## About the Project

- **Purpose**: The notebook was developed as part of a seminar presentation for an MSc course, demonstrating the application of polynomial fitting for regional-residual separation.
- **Method**: The project focuses on using polynomial fitting to separate large-scale regional trends from smaller-scale residual anomalies in data, a common technique in geophysics.
- **Tools Used**: 
  - **Python**
  - **Jupyter Notebook**
  - **Verde** from **Fatiando a Terra**

## Getting Started

To run the notebook, you will need to have Python and the required libraries installed. Key dependencies include:

- Python 3.8 or above
- Verde (`pip install verde`)
- Other standard libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open the notebook and follow the instructions to run the regional-residual separation analysis.
